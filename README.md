# IIA_SF1_Data_Analysis


## Description
This project introduces signal modelling/processing techniques and applies them to audio and musical signals. 
In the first two weeks, non-parametric methods based on transforms such as the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and its fast variant the FFT are studied and experiments are carried out with windowing, frequency resolution and noise reduction. 
In the last two weeks, I experimented on probabilistic inference methods and the exploration of the parametric models with estimation using least squares, maximum likelihood and Bayesian techniques. 
The constant model, the linear trend model, the autoregressive (AR) model and the sinusoidal model will be studied and analysed in detail. The model choice is studied within likelihood and Bayesian probabilistic settings as well. 
These techniques are applied in audio signals, using models to perform packet loss concealment, interpolation of missing data in audio, and constrained interpolation for clipped and/or heavily quantised signals.
